Problem statement
You are given a positive integer N, your task is to find all the Jumping Numbers smaller than or equal to N.

A number is defined as a Jumping Number if all adjacent digits in it have an absolute difference of 1.

Example :
2, 23, and 4343456 are Jumping numbers but 296 and 89498 are not.
Note:
The difference between ‘9’ and ‘0’ is not considered as 1. All single-digit numbers are considered as Jumping Numbers.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 10^8

Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
1
20
Sample Output 1:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12
Explanation For Sample Input 1:
These are all the jumping numbers from 0 to 12 as all the single-digit numbers are jumping numbers and out of the two-digit numbers only 10 and 12 are the jumping numbers less than 20 as the absolute difference in the adjacent digits of 10 and 12 is 1.
Sample Input 2:
2
1
30
Sample Output 2:
0 1
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 21 23
